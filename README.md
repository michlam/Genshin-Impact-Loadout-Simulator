# Genshin Impact Loadout Simulator
A loadout simulator for Genshin Impact to help you try out and build new teams.

## Project Description
This project aims to implement a simulator for Genshin Impact teams, characters, and weapons, similar to what is seen in game. This project is also to help me practice my fullstack development and to help me learn Java. 

### Phase 1
For the first phase, I plan to start small and only implement the basic teams and characters, with very minimal statistical information. The following list summarizes the phase 1 planned features:
- Users can create, login to, and logout of their accounts
- Users can add a character to their account
- Users can create teams with up to four characters
- Userss can create up to eight teams

### Technologies Used
- MySQL database setup for user accounts, characters, and teams
- Java and Spring backend, with the required REST APIs
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend that consumes the REST APIs
