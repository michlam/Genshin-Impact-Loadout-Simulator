While only the frontend is being permanently hosted online, the backend is still being hosted locally and will only be running occasionally. 

## Project Description
This project aims to implement a simulator for Genshin Impact teams, characters, and weapons, similar to what is seen in game. This project is also to help me practice my fullstack development and to help me learn Java, Spring, SQL, JavaScript, and React.

# Development Logs

### Features For Future Consideration
- Team damage calculations
- Character Stats
- Artifacts
- All characters and weapons until the most recent patch
- Deployment
- Accessibility

### Phase 2 - Completed 5/6/25
For the second phase, I plan introduce key upgrades to security and responsiveness, while adding weapons to the web application core functionality. This requires an update to the database schema, backend API, and new frontend pages to be built. Finally, I hope to expand the character selection as well.
- Users can view a list of weapons until patch 2.0.
- Users can add characters from until patch 2.0.
- Users can login with web tokens, with passwords encrypted in the database.
- Users can view the page hosted online.

### Phase 1 - Completed 3/3/25
For the first phase, I plan to start small and only implement the basic teams and characters, with very minimal statistical information. The following list summarizes the phase 1 planned features:
- Users can create, login to, and logout of their accounts
- Users can add a character to their account
- Users can create teams with up to four characters
- Users can create up to eight teams

### Technologies Used
- MySQL database setup for user accounts, characters, and teams
- Java and Spring backend, with the required REST APIs
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend that consumes the REST APIs
